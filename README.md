Altopilot provides a user interface for artificial intelligence to suggest writing completions on any website, similar to the autocomplete feature in Gmail. Altopilot allows anyone to easily implement their own AI to suggest completions for words, phrases, and sentences as users type.

We believe this tools is specially good for professionals who writes a lot, in which general models (like ChatGPT) still needs refinement, and where workflow integration matters. The story behind Altopilot is that I wanted my radiology colleages to have the same experience as I have with Github Copilot. Radiologists write a lot, as many other professionals do, so not only radiologists but everyone could benefit from it. E.g. medical writing, legal writing, sales, management etc. but also - and probably more important - general writing.

The benefit of being an open-source project is to become compatible with a wide range of websites, and flexible enough to constantly adapt and improve. It also allows AI developers to easily integrate their models, iterate with users, and improve them. Altopilot "Suggestion Navigation" was primarily designed as a low friction interface to provide human feedback for AI, eventually helping models to improve though reinforcement learning (RLHF) or other methods.
